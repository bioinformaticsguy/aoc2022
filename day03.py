--- Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization ---
You basically again have to calculate some 
sort of score. In the input you are given
the lines of random alphabet. Each line can be split
into two euqal sections i-e compartment A and 
compartment B. 


Steps:
    1:  Find out the duplicate items. More specifically
        Where items being the same characters in compartment A
        and in the compartment B. 
    2:  Find out score for each rucksack (Score is equal to the alphabet 
        index of the item a-z = 1-26 and A-Z = 27-52).
    3:  Find out the sum of all scores.


Part 2: Basically is slight changes to the part one. Now the rucksacks
the rows are supposed to be considered in the form of groups of three.
Then you find the common item among that group. The score of that group 
is the score for that specific common item in the group. Eventually you 
return the sum of scores.

Expnantion With the sample Input:
SðŸ˜€, as you can see that the lines contain just alphabets:
